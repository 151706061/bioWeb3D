\section{Input file formats}
\subsection{Raw data file}

\vbox{When you add a raw data file, a new Dataset section is going to be created in the "Data" panel of the application. One raw data file contains one dataset. The dataset is composed only of 3D coordinates (x,y,z) along with a few information about the dataset (optional name, optional "chain" boolean has to be set to true to link the points together). Here is what a minimal 3 points dataset file should look like :
\begin{lstlisting}
{ "dataset" : {
      "name" : "my superb dataset",
      "chain" : true,
        "points" : [
          [
            0.5,
            100,
            -50.5
          ],
          [
            200,
            10,
            0.0
          ],
          [
            3,
            250.15,
            15
          ]
        ]
     }
}
\end{lstlisting}}

\subsection{Cluster information files}

The cluster information file contains information about the dataset you have entered with the raw data file. There is no need to repeat the coordinates of the points, and as you can notice in the previous file, points don't have a unique ID. In fact the information you will enter in this file will have to keep the order of the points you defined in the first file. You can have multiple cluster sets in the same file each cluster set has :
\begin{itemize}
\item{a name}
\item{a number of categories called numClust}
\item{A list of labels for the clusters (optional)}
\end{itemize}
For example coming back to the 3 points defined previously, say I have : 
\begin{itemize}

\item{one clustering algorithm that put the first two together in the first cluster and the second one alone in a third cluster.}
\item{another clustering algorithm that put the 3 point in 3 separate clusters the file should look like that}
\end{itemize}
\vbox{
\begin{lstlisting}
{ "cluster" :
  [
    {
      "name": "clustering algo 1",
      "numClust": "2",
      "labels" : [
        "Category 1",
        "Category 2"
      ],
      "values": [
        1,
        1,
        2
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "clustering algo 2",
      "numClust": "3",
      "values": [
        1,
        2,
        3
      ]
    }
  ]
}
\end{lstlisting}}
